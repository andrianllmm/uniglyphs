    question: "How does it style text?",
    answer:
      "It replaces each character with its styled Unicode equivalent using offsets. For example, 'A' can become ùóî, ùòà, or ùíú depending on the selected style.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is Unicode?",
    answer:
      "Unicode is a universal standard that assigns a unique number to every character and symbol used in writing systems worldwide.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are Unicode offsets?",
    answer:
      "Offsets are just numerical jumps used to calculate the styled version of a character. For example, normal A = 65, bold ùêÄ = 120572, so the offset is added to transform it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are these styles just fonts?",
    answer:
      "No. These are actual characters that look like styled fonts. They work everywhere Unicode is supported, even in places where fonts can‚Äôt be changed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I use styled text?",
    answer:
      "Anywhere you can type‚Äîsocial media posts, chat, comments, bios, and more. If the platform supports Unicode, your styled text will show up as expected.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will styled text break anything?",
    answer:
      "They usually work fine, but some old devices, websites, and fonts may misinterpret certain characters. They may also be harder for screen readers to interpret, so use it thoughtfully.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use it on mobile devices?",
    answer:
      "Currently, the browser extension is designed for desktop. But you can still use this website on your phone, apply styles in the editor, and copypaste.",
